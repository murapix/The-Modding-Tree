Bugfixes and TODO:

- Hotkeys for Inflaton reset
- Hotkeys for navigating between tabs and layers
- Make some actually interesting Quantum boosts
- Shift power around a bit so Quantum Condense happens *after* Subspatial 2 - probably done?

- Scrap current Entropic Enhancements
- Replace with "pick an upgrade" rows, a la current WoW Talents
    - Columns: flat prod/prod based on acceleron/time speed/build cost/build speed/prod based on time cubes (unlocked later)

-----

Row 3 - Pick one at first

Inflatons
- Core idea: Start with a single inflaton, which massively duplicates itself, reaching max value within *seconds*
- Mechanics:
    - Series of simple "challenges", just reach the maximum inflaton count
    - Inflatons "consume" foam, pions, and spinors at a very tiny rate (of course this ends up consuming all of them by the end of the challenge)
    - Each completed challenge unlocks upgrades that "harden" spacetime, reducing the max inflaton count, their effect on other resources, and their duplication rate
    - After a few completed challenges, unlock accelerons and begin requiring acceleron resources for progression
    - Important: inflaton effect takes place outside challenges, but requires at least 2. Player will not be allowed to gain 2 until base completion
        - This will happen when foam/spinors/pions and inflatons both effectively hardcap (read: extreme softcap) each other

Accelerons:
- Core idea: Accelerons are gained at a flat rate, but also increase "tick speed". Build up and automate "entropic loops" for your fledgling universe
- Mechanics:
    - Two phases, expansion and compression
    - In expansion, gain accelerons and spend them on time-speed-boosting upgrades, mainly based on current accelerons (some later to change to max?)
    - In compression, accelerons are consumed to form entropic loops, which will give bonuses for partial completion in addition to normal completion awards
        - "tick speed" is locked in at this phase, and modifies the speed at which accelerons are consumed
        - An unfinished loop will be unstable and decay over time, losing progress while in the expansion phase
        - This phase is automatically disabled if the player reaches 1 acceleron (set back to 1 if they go under)
    - Only the first few entropic loops will be stable while complete, higher loops will require more and more inflatons and spacetime hardening
    - Goal is to complete a given number of entropic loops

Row 4 - Space and time are laid down, and so begin strings and forces

Strings: Decently small layer?

Forces: Effectively four mini-layers - Gluons, W/Z Bosons, Photons, and Gravitons

Higgs: Row 4, even though it's unlocked mid-Row 7 - create a Higgs field from Foam and Gravitons

-----

Row 5 - Particulate matter

Quarks: Start with Up and anti-Up, upgrade through Quark ranks

Leptons: Start with electrons, upgrade to muons and taus, generate neutrino versions on the side

-----

Row 6 - Hadronics

Baryons: stable, expensive

Mesons: simple but unstable, helps make Baryons easier

-----

Row 7 - Nuclear power

Atoms: Very simple and fast at first, but return here often. Start off just constructing Hydrogen from 

-----

Row 8 - Dust

Stars: Nuclear furnaces, created from the Higgs field acting on Hydrogen. Bigger stars make higher elements but cost much more, and more higher elements reduces lifespan

Supernovae: Reset stars to gain higher elements and denser dust
    Sub-layer: Nebulae: Boost star generation based on dust

Planets: Increase Star cost to randomly gain Planets - lower elements -> gas giants, higher elements -> rocky planets
        - Planets increase Star stability

-----

Row 9 - Finale

Life: Mostly hands-off? Not too sure about this layer at all

-----

Bonus modes? Alternate routes?
