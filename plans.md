  - Uses a slowly growing static time square cost formula

Need to figure out a decent reward structure for phase 2 completions

Phases

- After initial selection of forces, add left and right arrows to tree tab, to switch between phases
- Phase 1 contains all previous content
- Phase 2 contains layers for generating force fields and particles, then for generating superscale systems based on those (galaxies, nebulae, stars, planets, etc.)
    - Probably loosely base this around Shark Game structure
    - Similar prestige system to Shark Game's Climate, generated in Phase 3, with "universe type" being dictated by force selection
- Phase 3 is a super-prestige layer, use what you learned from going through Phase 2 to unlock more forces and to speed up progression

Universes:
- Standard (all first row) (our universe)
- Classical (all first row, except one switched to elemental?) (alchemy-based universe)
