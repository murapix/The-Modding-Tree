Change fourth Inflaton upgrade to unlock Skyrmion buyable 14 - increase Pion and Spinor gain based on log(log(Inflatons))?
Change Inflaton effect to show production gains while not inflating

Row 3 - Pick one at first

Inflatons
- Core idea: Start with two inflatons, which generate inflatons based on inflaton count and divide other resource counts
- Mechanics:
    - A single challenge, "Inflate", which brings you up to two inflatons - goal is to beat that challenge
    - Inflatons "consume" foam, pions, and spinors at a very tiny rate (of course this ends up consuming all of them by the end of the challenge)
    - Max inflaton milestones unlock upgrades that "harden" spacetime, reducing the inflaton effect on other resources and their duplication rate
    - After a few checkpoints, unlock accelerons and begin requiring acceleron resources for progression
    - Important: inflaton effect takes place outside challenges, but requires at least 2. Player will not be allowed to gain 2 until base completion
        - This will happen when foam/spinors/pions and inflatons both effectively hardcap (read: extreme softcap) each other

- Inflation challenge -> universe size
- universe size + subspatial foam? -> subspace buildings
- subspace buildings -> ??? energy
- ??? energy -> upgrades -> reduce inflaton effect (slightly)
                         -> unlock more building types -> some buildings divide one resource but give inflaton layer resources
                                                       -> some increase resource gain during inflation
                                                       -> some upgrade other buildings
                                                       -> etc.
- inflaton storage - keep some inflatons from a run started after storage was constructed
                   - anti-inflation bonuses are active outside of inflation, based on stored inflaton amount

Row 4 - Space and time are laid down, and so begin strings and forces

Strings: Decently small layer?

Forces: Construct a set of four fundamental forces from Strings, each provides a different mechanic to progress with in Phase 2

Phases

- After initial selection of forces, add left and right arrows to tree tab, to switch between phases
- Phase 1 contains all previous content
- Phase 2 contains layers for generating force fields and particles, then for generating superscale systems based on those (galaxies, nebulae, stars, planets, etc.)
    - Probably loosely base this around Shark Game structure
    - Similar prestige system to Shark Game's Climate, generated in Phase 3, with "universe type" being dictated by force selection
- Phase 3 is a super-prestige layer, use what you learned from going through Phase 2 to unlock more forces and to speed up progression
