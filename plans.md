TODO:
Post-Community content (large buildings, metal tools)
Monuments (expensive projects, start next run with a research completed - cost based on research)
Final overview modal, showing best/total resources, jobs, and buildings
Change sand from exponential -> linear
Increase wall distances (probably just +1)
Resource tooltips
Fix sand cleanup ordering - water > food > other jobs > normal buildings > terrain (also restore pre-sand jobs)
Resource bars sometimes show full background on no progress
Check if normal scrolling can go horizontal for research, and how to save the research scroll position

Overhaul:
Tutorial on first playthrough
Building unlock popups and info tab
More seasons

Research:

Trade/Warfare: Specialized expeditions      * probably not in time limit
