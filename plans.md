Bugfixes and TODO:

Skyrmion Upgrades: (4 remaining)
- ???
- ???

Upgrade Automation Challenges
- Big softcap to Beta effect, maybe increase Foam formation costs too?
    - Reach Foam milestones to buy remaining four Skyrmion autobuyers (Infinitesimal^2, Subspatial^2, Subplanck^2, Quantum^2)

Need to figure out a decent reward structure for phase 2 completions

Phase 1 Completion Steps:

Inflaton Upgrades:        0/5
- 1: Skyrmion             + 0/2
  - Upgrades              | + 6/8
  - Challenge             | + 0/3
    - Effects             |   + 0/1
    - Goals               |   + 0/1
    - Name                |   + 0/1
- 2: Time Cubes           + 0/2
  - Upgrades              | + 0/10
  - Other Features        | + 0/1+
- 3: Research             + 0/2
  - Researches            | + 0/25+
  - Repeatables           | + 0/0-3+
- 4: Hyperspace Buildings + 0/2
  - Buildings             | + 0/6
  - Other Features        | + 0/1+
- 5: Acceleron            + 0/2
  - Loops                   + 0/3
  - Infinite Cycle          + 0/1

Phases

- After initial selection of forces, add left and right arrows to tree tab, to switch between phases
- Phase 1 contains all previous content
- Phase 2 contains layers for generating force fields and particles, then for generating superscale systems based on those (galaxies, nebulae, stars, planets, etc.)
    - Probably loosely base this around Shark Game structure
    - Similar prestige system to Shark Game's Climate, generated in Phase 3, with "universe type" being dictated by force selection
- Phase 3 is a super-prestige layer, use what you learned from going through Phase 2 to unlock more forces and to speed up progression
